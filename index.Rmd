# Introduction

This book provides the materials that we will use in Watershed Analysis (ENSC 445/545). In this class we will be learning the fundamentals of watershed analysis in R. 

Instructor: Dr. Tim Covino\
Class times: T 10:50 – 12:05; Th 10:50 – 12:05\

## Course overview and objectives: 
(1) provide theoretical understanding and practical experience with the most common analysis and modeling techniques relevant to watershed hydrology; \

(2) provide training in analyzing, simulating, and presenting scientific data in written and oral formats.

## Structure: 
This class will be largely hands-on, and students will be conducting watershed analyses and modeling exercises. We will follow a typical weekly format of Tuesday in-class lecture and activities, Thursday hands-on computational work, and time spent working through online modules outside of class. The online modules are required and are intended to prepare students for the in-class work during lab on Thursday. Accordingly, this class will follow a semi-flipped format that includes in-class lecture, online modules, and in-class work sessions.

## Philosophical approach and books & resources we will utilize: 
This course will use all online and open-source resources and will follow FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) data principles and promote sharing of hydrological education and research materials. Our computing will utilze open source [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) software. Books and readings will include [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) and [Statistical Methods in Water Resources](https://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/04/a03/tm4a3.pdf), but other readings will be made available on this bookdown page as needed. *We will promote an open, equitable, and collaborative environment such that we can all succeed and improve our skills in watershed analysis*.
