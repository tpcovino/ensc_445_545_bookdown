In this class we will be learning the fundamentals of watershed analysis in R. Instructor: Dr. Tim Covino Class times: T 10:50 – 12:05; Th 10:50 – 12:05 Office hours: By appointment Email: timothy.covino@montana.edu Website: https://tpcovino.github.io/ensc_445_545_bookdown 1.1 Course overview and objectives provide theoretical understanding and practical experience with common analysis and modeling techniques relevant to watershed hydrology. provide training in analyzing, simulating, and presenting scientific data in written and oral formats. 1.2 Structure This class will be largely hands-on, and students will be conducting watershed analyses and modeling exercises. We will be doing our analysis and modeling in R and will do some R coding in each class session. Programming is best learned by doing it often. We will generally have “lecture” on Tuesday, where we will talk about and work through various types of hydrological analyses. On Thursday’s you will then put the content from Tuesday to work in a lab where you will complete a variety of hydrological analyses in R. Philosophical approach and books &amp; resources we will utilize This course will use all online and open-source resources and will follow FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) data principles and promote sharing of hydrological education and research materials. Our computing will utilize open source R and RStudio software. Books and readings will include R for Data Science and Statistical Methods in Water Resources, but other readings will be made available on this bookdown page as needed. We will promote an open, equitable, and collaborative environment such that we can all succeed and improve our skills in watershed analysis. Here are instructions for installing R and RStudio on your own computer if you would like Hands on Programming with R 1.3 Tentative schedule, subject to change Week 1: - Lecture (1/14): Introduction, review.
