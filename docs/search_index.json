In this class we will be learning the fundamentals of watershed analysis in R. Instructor: Dr. Tim Covino Class times: T 10:50 – 12:05; Th 10:50 – 12:05 Office hours: By appointment Website: https://tpcovino.github.io/ensc_445_545_bookdown 1.1 Course overview and objectives: provide theoretical understanding and practical experience with the most common analysis and modeling techniques relevant to watershed hydrology; provide training in analyzing, simulating, and presenting scientific data in written and oral formats. 1.2 Structure: This class will be largely hands-on, and students will be conducting watershed analyses and modeling exercises. We will follow a typical weekly format of Tuesday in-class lecture and activities, Thursday hands-on computational work, and time spent working through online modules outside of class. The online modules are required and are intended to prepare students for the in-class work during lab on Thursday. Accordingly, this class will follow a semi-flipped format that includes in-class lecture, online modules, and in-class work sessions. 1.3 Philosophical approach and books &amp; resources we will utilize: This course will use all online and open-source resources and will follow FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) data principles and promote sharing of hydrological education and research materials. Our computing will utilze open source R and RStudio software. Books and readings will include R for Data Science and Statistical Methods in Water Resources, but other readings will be made available on this bookdown page as needed. We will promote an open, equitable, and collaborative environment such that we can all succeed and improve our skills in watershed analysis. 1.4 Tentative schedule, subject to change: Week 1 (Unit 1): Introduction, overview, and technical skills. Reading Chapters 1, 2, &amp; 3 1-Welcome, 2-Introduction, &amp; 3-Data visualization in R for Data Science (RDS). Week 2 (Units 1 &amp; 2): Technical skills continued.
