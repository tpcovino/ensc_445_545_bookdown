Instructor: Dr. Tim Covino Class times: T 10:50 – 12:05; Th 10:50 – 12:05 Office hours: By appointment Website: https://tpcovino.github.io/ensc_445_545_bookdown 1.1 Course overview and objectives provide theoretical understanding and practical experience with common analysis and modeling techniques relevant to watershed hydrology. provide training in analyzing, simulating, and presenting scientific data in written and oral formats. 1.2 Structure This class will be largely hands-on, and students will be conducting watershed analyses and modeling exercises. We will be doing our analysis and modeling in R and will do some R coding in each class session. Programming is best learned by doing it often. We will generally have “lecture” on Tuesday, where we will talk about and work through various types of hydrological analyses. On Thursday’s you will then put the content from Tuesday to work in a lab where you will complete a variety of hydrological analyses in R. 1.3 Philosophical approach and books &amp; resources we will utilize This course will use all online and open-source resources and will follow FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) data principles and promote sharing of hydrological education and research materials. Our computing will utilze open source R and RStudio software. Books and readings will include R for Data Science and Statistical Methods in Water Resources, but other readings will be made available on this bookdown page as needed. We will promote an open, equitable, and collaborative environment such that we can all succeed and improve our skills in watershed analysis. 1.4 Tentative schedule, subject to change Week 1 (Unit 1): - Lecture (1/19): Introduction, overview, and technical skills. - Reading: Chapters 1, 2, &amp; 3 1-Welcome, 2-Introduction, &amp; 3-Data visualization in R for Data Science (RDS).

A great way to do this is through data visualization. At the end of todays activities students will be able to: Load data to RStudio Visualize data by making plots/figures Install and load packages Begin coding using tidyverse Have an understanding of projects and folder management Knit .Rmd to .html Follow this link to download everything you need for this unit. When you get to GitHub click on “Code” (green button) and select “download zip”. You will then save this to a local folder where you should do all of your work for this class. You will work through the “_blank.Rmd”. Always be sure to read the README.md files in the GitHub repo. Once you have this folder saved where you would like it, open RStudio and navigate to the folder. Next, open the project (“.Rproj”). Doing so will set the folder as the working directory, make your life easier, and make everything generally work. The use of projects is highly recommended and is the practice we will follow in this class. You will learn more about projects later, for now just know they are useful and make things easier. In this unit we want to start familiarizing ourselves with R by visualizing some hydrological data. The reading for this week will also begin to get you more familiar with R and RStudio. Please read Chapters 1, 2, &amp; 3 1-Welcome, 2-Introduction, &amp; 3-Data visualization in R for Data Science (RDS). 2.2 Download and install tidyverse library We will use the tidyverse a lot this semester. It is a suite of packages that handles plotting and data wrangling efficiently. You only have to install the library once. You have to load it using the library() function each time you start an R session. #install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) library(tidyverse) 2.3 Reading data The following lines will read in the data we will use for this exercise. Don’t worry about this right now beyond running it, we will talk more about it later.

Basic ggplot syntax 2.4 Our first ggplot Let’s look at the Pine data, plotting streamflow (the cfs column) by the date (datetime column). We will show the time series as a line. ggplot(data = Pine, aes(x = datetime, y = cfs)) + geom_line() 2.5 Change point type Now let’s make the same plot but show the data as points, using the shape parameter in geom_point() we can change the point type to any of the following: See here ggplot(data = Pine, aes(x = datetime, y = cfs))+ geom_point(shape = 5) 2.6 Set colors We can also “easily” change the color. Easily is in quotes because this often trips people up. If you put color = “blue” in the aesthetic function, think about what that is telling ggplot. It says “control the color using”blue”“. That doesn’t make a whole lot of sense, so neither does the output… Try it. What happens is that if color = “blue” is in the aesthetic, you are telling R that the color used in the geom represents “blue”. This is very useful if you have multiple geoms in your plot, are coloring them differently, and are building a legend. But if you are just trying to color the points, it kind of feels like R is trolling you… doesn’t it? Take the color = “blue” out of the aesthetic and you’re golden. ggplot(data = Pine, aes(x = datetime, y = cfs, color = &quot;blue&quot;))+ geom_point() ggplot(data = Pine, aes(x = datetime, y = cfs))+ geom_point(color = &quot;blue&quot;) 2.7 Controlling color with a third variable and other functions Let’s plot the data as a line again, but play with it a bit. First: make the line blue ggplot(data = Pine, aes(x = datetime, y = cfs)) + geom_line(color = &quot;blue&quot;) Second: change the theme See ggplot themes here ggplot(data = Pine, aes(x = datetime, y = cfs)) + geom_line(color = &quot;blue&quot;) + theme_linedraw() Third: change the axis labels ggplot(data = Pine, aes(x = datetime, y = cfs)) + geom_line(color = &quot;blue&quot;) + theme_linedraw() + labs(x = &quot;Date&quot;, y = &quot;Q (cfs)&quot;) Fourth: color by discharge See here for changing axis labels and coloring by a variable (in this case discharge) ggplot(data = Pine, aes(x = datetime, y = cfs, color = cfs)) + geom_line() + theme_linedraw() + labs(x = &quot;Date&quot;, y = &quot;Q (cfs)&quot;) 2.8 Plotting multiple groups (adding a third variable) The SNP dataset has two different streams: Pine and NFDR We can look at the two of those a couple of different ways. First, make two lines, colored by the stream by adding color = to your aesthetic. Remember that we can have a look at column headers with head(df), if you need to remind yourself of variable names. ggplot(data = SNP, aes(x = datetime, y = cfs, color = StationID)) + geom_line() Now use what we just did to make that figure look better. ggplot(data = SNP, aes(x = datetime, y = cfs, color = StationID)) + geom_line() + labs(x = &quot;Date&quot;, y = &quot;Q (cfs)&quot;, color = &quot;Stream&quot;) + theme_linedraw(base_size = 18) 2.9 Facets We can also use facets. You must tell the facet_wrap what variable to use to make the separate panels (facets =). It’ll decide how to orient them or you can tell it how. We want them to be on top of each other so we are going to tell it we want 2 rows by setting nrow = 2. Note that we have to put the column used to make the facets in quotes after facets = ggplot(data = SNP, aes(x = datetime, y = cfs)) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(facets = &quot;StationID&quot;, nrow = 2) 2.10 Two variable faceting You can also use facet_grid() to break your plots up into panels based on two variables. Below we will create a panel for each month in each watershed. Adding scales = “free” allows facet_grid to change the axes. By default, all axes will be the same. This is often what we want, so we can more easily compare magnitudes, but sometimes we are looking for patterns more, so we may want to let the axes have whatever range works for the individual plots. ggplot(data = SNP, aes(x = datetime, y = cfs)) + geom_line() + facet_grid(StationID ~ month, scales = &quot;free&quot;) 2.11 Boxplots We can look at these data in other ways as well. A very useful way to look at the variation of two groups is to use a boxplot. Because the data span several orders of magnitude, we will have to log the y axis to see the differences between the two streams. We do that by adding scale_y_log10() ggplot(data = SNP, aes(x = StationID, y = cfs)) + stat_boxplot() + scale_y_log10() To investigate the boxplot more closely we can use “plotly”. #install.packages(&quot;plotly&quot;) library(plotly) ggplotly(ggplot(data = SNP, aes(x = StationID, y = cfs)) + stat_boxplot()+ scale_y_log10() ) 2.12 More about color, size, etc Let’s play around a bit with controlling color, point size, etc with other data. We can control the size of points by putting size = in the aes() and color by putting color = ggplot(RBI, aes(x = DRAIN_SQKM, y = RBI, size = T_AVG_SITE, color = STATE))+ geom_point() If you use a point type that has a background, like #21, you can also set the background color using bg = If points are too close together to see them all you can use a hollow point type or set the alpha lower so the points are transparent (alpha = ) ggplot(data = RBI, aes(x = DRAIN_SQKM, y = RBI, size = T_AVG_SITE, bg = STATE))+ geom_point(pch = 21, alpha = 0.3) You can also easily make that an interactive plot with ggplotly. Try doing that. 2.13 Multiple geoms Finally: You can add multiple geoms to the same plot. Examples of when you might want to do this are when you are showing point data and you want to have a line connecting them. Or if you are fitting a linear model to two data sets and you want to show each. These are just two examples. There are many other reasons you would do this. Point being you simply add additional geom_… lines to add additional geoms. See here for information on linetype aesthetics. Using a “dashed” linetype to connect point measurements is a common approach. ggplot(data = RBI, aes(x = RBI, y = DRAIN_SQKM, color = STATE))+ geom_line(linetype = &quot;dashed&quot;) + geom_point() ggplot(data = RBI, aes(x = RBI, y = DRAIN_SQKM, color = AGGECOREGION))+ stat_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, linetype = 2)+ geom_point() ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = &#39;y ~ x&#39; That’s it for today! 2.14 Exit ticket Write a code that generates a ggplot from a data frame called df and plots Date on the x-axis, discharge on the y-axis as a line, and colors by gauging_station.

So now let’s review or introduce you to some basics. Even if you have worked in R before, it is good to be remind of/practice with this stuff, so stay tuned in! This exercise covers most of the same principles as two chapters in R for Data Science Workflow: basics Data transformation 3.2 You can use R as a calculator If you just type numbers and operators in, R will spit out the results. It is generally good to run one line of code at a time. In mac you do that by putting your cursor on the line and hitting command + enter. On windows/PC that is ctrl + enter. Here is a link to info on Editing and Executing code in RStudio Very handy link to all keyboard shortcuts Windows, Linux and Mac 1 + 2 2 + 2 3.3 You can create new objects using &lt;- Yes, = does the same thing. But use &lt;-. We will call &lt;- assignment or assignment operator. When we are coding in R we use &lt;- to assign values to objects and = to set values for parameters in functions/equations/etc. Using &lt;- helps us differentiate between the two. Norms for formatting are important because they help us understand what code is doing, especially when stuff gets complex. Oh, one more thing: Surround operators with spaces. x &lt;- 1 is easier to read than x&lt;-1 You can assign single numbers or entire chunks of data using &lt;- So if you had an object called my_data and wanted to copy it into my_new_data you could do: my_new_data &lt;- my_data You can then recall/print the values in an object by just typing the name by itself. In the code chunk below, assign a 3 to the object “y” and then print it out. # This is a code chunk. # Putting a hash mark in here allows me to type text that is not code. # The stuff below is code. Not text. y &lt;- 3 y If you want to assign multiple values, you have to put them in the function c() c means combine. R doesn’t know what to do if you just give it a bunch of values with space or commas, but if you put them as arguments in the combine function, it’ll make them into a vector. Any time you need to use several values, even passing as an argument to a function, you have to put them in c() or it won’t work. a &lt;- c(1,2,3,4) a When you are creating objects, try to give them meaningful names so you can remember what they are. You can’t have spaces or operators that mean something else as part of a name. And remember, everything is case sensitive. Assign the value 5.4 to water_pH and then try to recall it by typing “water_ph” water_pH &lt;- 5.4 #water_ph If we want to remove something from the environment we can use rm(). Try to remove water_pH. You can also set objects equal to strings, or values that have letters in them. To do this you just have to put the value in quotes, otherwise R will think it is an object name and tell you it doesn’t exist. Try: name &lt;- “your name” and then name &lt;- your name What happens if you forget the ending parenthesis? R can be cryptic with it’s error messages or other responses, but once you get used to them, you know exactly what is wrong when they pop up. As a note - when you go to the internet for example code it will often say things like df &lt;- your_data, this is similar to what I’ve written above: name &lt;- “your name”. It means enter you name (or your data). As you progress you will get better at understanding example code and understanding error messages. name &lt;- &quot;Tim&quot; #name &lt;- Tim 3.4 Using functions As an example, let’s try the seq() function, which creates a sequence of numbers. seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 1) #or seq(1, 10, 1) #or seq(1, 10) #what does this do seq(10,1) 3.5 Read in some data. First we will load the tidyverse library, everything we have done so far today is in base R. Next, let’s load a few dataframes and have a look at them. We will load the “PINE_NFDR_Jan-Mar_2010.csv” and ““flashy_dat_all.csv” files. Important: read_csv() is the tidyverse csv reading function, the base R function is read.csv(). read.csv() will not read your data in as a tibble, which is the format used by tidyverse functions. You should get in the habit of using the tidyverse versions such as read_csv(). library(tidyverse) flow &lt;- read_csv(&quot;PINE_NFDR_Jan-Mar_2010.csv&quot;) rbi &lt;- read_csv(&quot;flashy_dat_all.csv&quot;) 3.6 What is a tibble? Good question. It’s a fancy way to store data that works well with tidyverse functions. Let’s look at the flow tibble with “head” and “str” head(flow) str(flow) Now read in the same data with read.csv() which will NOT read the data as a tibble. How is it different? Output each one in the Console. Knowing the data type for each column is super helpful for a few reasons…. let’s talk about them. 3.7 Data wrangling in dplyr If you forget syntax or what the following functions do, here is an excellent cheat sheet: https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf We will demo five functions below: filter() - returns rows that meet specified conditions arrange() - reorders rows select() - pull out variables (columns) mutate() - create new variables (columns) or reformat existing ones summarize() - collapse groups of values into summary stats 3.8 Filter Write an expression that returns data in rbi for the state of Montana (MT) filter(rbi, STATE == &quot;MT&quot;) And one that keeps flows less than 100 cfs in the “flow” dataframe. filter(flow, cfs &lt; 100) Above we just executed the operation, but didn’t save it. Let’s save that work using the assignment operator. rbi_mt &lt;- filter(rbi, STATE == &quot;MT&quot;) low_flows &lt;- filter(flow, cfs &lt; 100) 3.8.1 Multiple conditions How many gages are there in Montana with an rbi greater than 0.05 filter(rbi, STATE == &quot;MT&quot; &amp; RBI &gt; 0.05) Challenge: Filter for flow less than 100 cfs just for the NFDR gauge in “flow”. 3.9 Arrange Arrange sorts by a column in your dataset. Sort the rbi data by the RBI column in ascending and then descending order arrange(rbi, RBI) arrange(rbi, desc(RBI)) 3.10 Select Look at the RBI dataframe. There are too many columns! You will often want to get rid of some columns and clean up the dataframe (df) for analysis. Select Site name, state, and RBI from the rbi data Note they come back in the order you put them in in the function, not the order they were in in the original data. You can do a lot more with select, especially when you need to select a bunch of columns but don’t want to type them all out. For example, if you want to select a group of columns you can specify the first and last with a colon in between (first:last) and it’ll return all of them. Select the rbi columns from site_no to DRAIN_SQKM. You can also remove one column with select(-column). Remove the “surrogate” column from flow. rbi_mt_thin &lt;- select(rbi, STANAME, STATE, RBI) rbi_thin &lt;- select(rbi, site_no:DRAIN_SQKM) flow_thin &lt;- select(flow, -surrogate) 3.11 Mutate Use mutate to add new columns based on additional ones. Common uses are to create a column of data in different units, or to calculate something based on two columns. You can also use it to just update a column, by naming the new column the same as the original one (but be careful because you’ll lose the original one!). Create a new column in rbi called T_RANGE by subtracting T_MIN_SITE from T_MAX_SITE mutate(rbi, T_RANGE = T_MAX_SITE - T_MIN_SITE) When downloading data from the USGS through R, you have to enter the gage ID as a character, even though they are all made up of numbers. So to practice doing this, update the site_no column to be a character datatype mutate(rbi, site_no = as.character(site_no)) 3.12 Summarize Summarize will perform an operation on all of your data, or groups if you assign groups. Use summarize to compute the mean, min, and max rbi rbi_sum &lt;- summarize(rbi, meanrbi = mean(RBI), maxrbi = max(RBI), minrbi = min(RBI)) Now use the group function to group rbi by state and then summarize in the same way as above, but for the full r rbi_state &lt;- group_by(rbi, STATE) rbi_state &lt;- summarize(rbi_state, meanrbi = mean(RBI), maxrbi = max(RBI), minrbi = min(RBI)) 3.13 Multiple operations with pipes You will note that your environment is filling up with objects. We can eliminate many of those by using pipes. The pipe operator %&gt;% allows you to perform multiple operations in a sequence without saving intermediate steps. Not only is this more efficient, but structuring operations with pipes is also more intuitive than nesting functions within functions (the other way you can do multiple operations). When you use the pipe, it basically takes whatever came out of the first function and puts it into the data argument for the next one, so: rbi %&gt;% group_by(STATE) is the same as group_by(rbi, STATE) Take the groupby and summarize code from above and perform the operation using the pipe rbi_sum &lt;- rbi %&gt;% group_by(STATE) %&gt;% summarize(meanrbi = mean(RBI), maxrbi = max(RBI), minrbi = min(RBI)) 3.14 A final comment on NAs We will talk more about this when we discuss stats, but some operations will fail if there are NA’s in the data. If appropriate, you can tell functions like mean() to ignore NAs by using na.rm = TRUE. You can also use drop_na() if you’re working with a tibble. But be aware if you use that and save the result, drop_na() gets rid of the whole row, not just the NA. Because what would you replace it with…. an NA? First, lets create a small data frame called x that includes: 1, 2, 3, 4, NA. How do we do that? x &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,NA) Next, lets take the mean of x. mean(x) How do you think we can fix this problem? mean(x, na.rm = TRUE) 3.15 That’s it for today Can you run all of the code in this unit? Do you get errors? If you are working on a lab computer have you gotten your folder management set up? 3.16 Exit ticket If you have an error or problem we need to manage - let me know.
